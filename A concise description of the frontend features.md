This frontend interface provides a secure and user-friendly OTP verification system featuring auto-focus input fields, OTP masking, and a tooltip guide for improved accessibility. It includes a real-time countdown timer for OTP expiration, a loader animation to simulate processing, and support for automatic OTP autofill via SMS and simulated email delivery. The system generates OTPs dynamically, encrypts them using AES (via CryptoJS), and validates user input securely. Additionally, users can resend the code with a cooldown mechanism, ensuring both usability and protection against abuse.
